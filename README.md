### Overview 

[![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/applift/hasoffersv3.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/applift/hasoffersv3)

### Synopsis

This gem provides a wrapper around HasOffers API in version 3, [HasOffers APIv3 Documentation](http://developers.hasoffers.com/#/brand).

### Compatibility

Supported ruby versions:

*   1.9.3
*   2.0
*   2.1
*   2.2

## Installation

    gem install hasoffersv3

## Usage

First, check if the method you want to call is already defined in `hasoffersv3/lib/hasoffersv3/*`. If not, you will need to add the method yourself (either just use your fork or submit a PR with your changes).

Next, create an initializer in your project in `config/intializers` and configure your API credentials like so:

```ruby
HasOffersV3.configure do |config|
  config.api_key    = ENV['YOUR_HAS_OFFERS_API_KEY']
  config.network_id = ENV['YOUR_HAS_OFFERS_NETWORK_ID']
end
```

You can now use the defined methods, following this pattern:


```ruby
HasOffersV3::ControllerName.snake_case_method_name
```

If HasOffers method does not take any parameters, then API also doesn't take them, otherwise it should be always a hash.

Naming is the same as in HasOffers documentation, also if it requires attributes then API will raise an exception if it's missing.

Examples:

```ruby
HasOffersV3::Affiliate.update_payment_method_wire({ affiliate_id: '877', data: {} })
```

  or when working with forms:

```ruby
HasOffersV3::Advertiser.signup({
  account: {
    company: params[:company_name],
    country: params[:company_country],
    address1: 'Change me 123',
    zipcode: '123123'
  },
  user: {
    first_name: params[:user_name],
    email: params[:user_email],
    password: params[:user_password],
    password_confirmation: params[:user_password_confirmation]
  },
  return_object: 1
})
```

## Testing

If `RAILS_ENV` or `RACK_ENV` is set to `test`, or there's a `TEST`
environment variable, it will require the HasOffersV3::Testing module
and enable testing mode. In testing mode all requests will return
stubbed successful response with empty data set.

When you need to disable testing mode:

```ruby
HasOffersV3::Testing.disable!
```

When you want to provide custom stub:

```ruby
HasOffersV3::Testing.stub_request status_code, body
```
